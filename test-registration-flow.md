# Registration Flow Test Guide

## 🧪 Testing the Fixed Registration & Navigation

### ✅ **What Was Fixed:**

1. **UserContext Mock Mode Support**:
   - Now works without wallet connection in dev mode
   - Uses default address `0x742d35Cc5FE4C9c5b6f8e8F57b7dB8D8d8d8d8d8` for mock operations
   - Properly initializes user state even without wallet

2. **Connect Page Navigation Logic**:
   - Fixed: No longer requires `isConnected` AND `isRegistered` in mock mode
   - Fixed: Now navigates on `(!userLoading && currentUser?.isRegistered && (isConnected || DEV))`
   - Added debug logging to trace navigation decision

3. **Mock Service Profile Creation**:
   - Fixed: Now actually updates mock data when `createProfile` is called
   - Creates proper user profile with `isActive: true` (registered status)
   - Uses consistent default address for mock operations

4. **UI Logic Improvements**:
   - Shows registration form in dev mode even without wallet
   - Better messaging for mock vs real mode
   - Proper conditional rendering for dev mode

### 🎯 **Expected Flow:**

#### In Mock Mode (Development):
1. **Page Load**: Connect page loads with "Get Started with SmartBlock"
2. **Auto-Init**: UserContext fetches profile for default mock address
3. **Show Form**: Registration form appears (no wallet needed)
4. **Register**: Enter username (e.g., "oyeee") and submit
5. **Update**: Mock service updates the user profile with `isActive: true`
6. **Navigate**: Page detects registration and navigates to `/feed`

#### In Real Mode (Production):
1. **Connect Wallet**: User must connect wallet first
2. **Check Network**: Verify correct network (Sepolia)
3. **Check Registration**: Fetch user profile from blockchain
4. **Register/Navigate**: Either show registration form or navigate to feed

### 🚀 **Test Steps:**

1. **Start Dev Server**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Check Console Logs**:
   - Look for: `🔧 Dev mode: Fetching user profile without wallet connection`
   - Look for: `Mock service auto-initializing...`

3. **Test Registration**:
   - Enter any username (e.g., "testuser123")
   - Click Register
   - Look for: `Mock: Created profile for testuser123`
   - Look for: `✅ User registered, navigating to feed...`

4. **Verify Navigation**:
   - Should automatically redirect to `/feed`
   - Should see the main app interface

### 🔍 **Debug Information:**

The navigation logic now logs debug info:
```javascript
console.log('✅ User registered, navigating to feed...', {
  isConnected,      // May be false in mock mode (OK)
  userLoading,      // Should be false
  isRegistered,     // Should be true after registration
  isDev: true       // Should be true in dev mode
});
```

### 🎉 **Success Indicators:**

✅ **Registration form appears immediately** (no wallet connection required in dev)
✅ **Username submission works** and shows "Mock: Created profile for [username]"
✅ **Navigation happens automatically** after successful registration
✅ **Feed page loads** with mock data
✅ **Data Mode Indicator shows "MOCK"** in bottom-right corner

**The registration and navigation flow is now fixed for both mock and real modes!** 🚀
